I'll graduate as Master of Science in Computer Science in May 2021 and am actively looking for full-time Software Developer/Software Engineer postions. Also searching for co-op and internship in spring and summer 2021 if graduate in Dec 2021. I was a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Washington University.
